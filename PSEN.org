* Introduction
This document constitutes the piping engineering note for {{{SYS_NAME}}}.
The current version of the document is maintained in Team Center {{{DOC_NUM}}}.

During the 2020 IB1 Shutdown the TeV Quench tanks will be disconnected from the IB1 cryo system. Connection piping will be cut off and capped off at following locations (see Figure [[fig:P_ID]], [[fig:P_ID2]] for details).
1. FCV-931A
2. FCV-930
3. HV-607
4. HV-606

Check valves FCV-931A and FCV-930 will be removed and replaced by threaded caps (see Figure [[fig:P_ID2]]). This part of piping is rated to 250 psig. Based on previous experience such disconnection doesn't constitute change per FESHM 5031.1 and excluded from requirements of engineering documentation and pressure testing. The change is listed here for consistency.

Other locations are part of the IB1 piping system rated to 100 psig and will have piping cut off and welded caps added.
No additional piping will be introduced with this change.

The design pressure for {{{SYS_NAME}}} is src_python{print(f'{P_des.to(ureg.psig):.3g~}')}
and is consistent with IB1 piping system pressure rating.


The P&ID of the {{{SYS_NAME}}} is shown in Figure [[fig:P_ID]].

* Design codes and evaluation criteria
All the piping must meet all of the requirements of Section 5031.1 of the Fermilab ES&H Manual.
#+begin_src python
  print('This section states that piping systems containing gas at a pressure ')
  if P_des > 150 * ureg.psig or T_des < -20 * ureg.degF:
      CATEGORY = 'Normal'
      print('above 150 psig or a temperature below -20 Fahrenheit fall under the category of Normal Fluid Service ')
  else:
      CATEGORY = 'D'
      print('below 150 psig and a temperature above -20 Fahrenheit fall under the Category D Fluid Service ')
  print('and shall adhere to the requirements of the ASME Process Piping Code B31.3.')

#+begin_src python
print(pipes[0].material.name+'.')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

The respective allowable stress from Table A-1 of ASME B31.3 will be used in this analysis.

The {{{SYS_NAME}}} will be operated at temperatures down to src_python{print(f'{T_des.to(ureg.K):.3g~} ({T_des.to(ureg.degF):.3g})')}.
#+begin_src python
  if any(T_des < pipe.material.T_min for pipe in pipes):
    print('This is below the minimum temperature listed for any stainless steel pipe or tube. According to B31.3 Section 323.2.2, impact testing is required for this material except as stated in Table 323.2.2 Note (6) where impact testing is not required when the minimum obtainable Charpy specimen has a width along the notch of less than 2.5 mm (0.098 in).')
    if not any(pipe.wall >= 0.098*ureg.inch for pipe in pipes):
      print('All of the tubing and piping with design minimum temperature below -20 F used in the {{{SYS_NAME}}} has a wall thickness of less than 0.098 in. Therefore, impact testing is not required for this piping system.')
  else:
    print('This is above the minimum temperature listed for all materials used in the system. According to B31.3 Section 323.2.2 (d), impact testing is not required for base metal of such piping.')


#+end_src
The same rule applies to HAZ and welded metal.

#+begin_comment
It should also be noted that Fermilab has extensive service experience using the 300 series stainless steel at liquid nitrogen temperatures and below.

Wall thickness of the 1.5” SCH 10 pipe is 0.109” which is greater than minimum obtainable Charpy specimen. According to Policy for Fracture Toughness Testing Requirements for Pressure Systems and Components at Low Cryogenic Temperatures  from 5/7/2010 recommends:
“As an alternative to B31.3 323.2.2 and Table 323.2.2 cells A‐4 and B‐4, high alloy steel materials (austenitic stainless steels) listed in Section VIII Div 1 Table UHA‐ 23 used in cryogenic piping with MDMTs colder than 77 K may instead be subjected to all requirements of UHA‐51.”
UHA-51 (g) exempts from impact testing materials listed in Table UHA-23, except as modified by UHA-51 (c), when ratio of design stress to allowable stress is less than 0.35. UHA-51 (c) (1) requires impact testing if the material has been thermally treated at temperatures between 900 F and 1650 F for austenitic steel. Off-the-shelf 304 and 316 steel is subject to annealing at temperatures above 1800 F and, therefore, is exempt from this requirement. As shown in Table 4.1, design stress to allowable stress ratio is less than 0.35 and impact testing is not required.

Minimum design temperature of He piping is 77 K. According to “Charpy Impact Testing at LN2 Temperature” Memo (ED0004216):
“All Charpy impact testing requirements have been satisfied for using 304 and 304L piping components with 308L filler metal and a wall thickness of less than 0.359”.  The extensive and successful experience Fermilab has had with the materials listed above has been reinforced with successful Charpy impact testing.  No further testing should be required for most LN2 piping assemblies fabricated by AD/Cryo as long as thickness requirements are met.”
All piping has wall thickness less than 0.359” and satisfies this requirement.
