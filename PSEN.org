* Introduction
The Noble Liquid Test Facility (NLTF) is undergoing a cryogenic upgrade. The goal of this upgrade is to replace the existing liquid argon and liquid nitrogen distribution systems with a new system that allows for higher filtering capacity and faster fills. The project is divided into several phases to minimize the impact on the NLTF's operations. The first phase of the project involves the installation of a new liquid argon (LAr) transfer line, LAr filter, and regeneration system. This document focuses on the /regeneration system/.

The regeneration system mixes the gas argon from the storage dewar with the hydrogen-argon mixture from the tube trailer. Gas argon supply from the dewar is designed for 125 psi and operates at ambient temperature, falling into Category D of B31.3. Per FESHM, Category D piping doesn't require a formal engineering note and is not included in this document.

Tubing upstream of the pressure regulator is rated to
src_python{print(f'{P_des_h:,.0f~}')}
to match the MAWP of the tube trailer as shown on Fig. [[fig:tube_trailer]]. This high pressure part of the system will be operated at ambient temperature. For all other tubing and piping the design parameters are listed below.

** Introduction to Amendment D
A new flexible hose rated to 350 psig will be used to replace an existing hose that connects the LAr storage dewar with the LAr transfer line. This will allow the storage tank to be operated at 315 psig or 90\nbsp{}% of 350 psig set pressure of the reliefs on the storage tank. This amendment covers both changes.
No modifications including welding or brazing is done to the existing LAr transfer line.
* Design codes and evaluation criteria
All the piping must meet all of the requirements of Section 5031.1 of the Fermilab ES&H Manual.

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_comment
It should also be noted that Fermilab has extensive service experience using the 300 series stainless steel at liquid nitrogen temperatures and below.

Wall thickness of the 1.5” SCH 10 pipe is 0.109” which is greater than minimum obtainable Charpy specimen. According to Policy for Fracture Toughness Testing Requirements for Pressure Systems and Components at Low Cryogenic Temperatures  from 5/7/2010 recommends:
“As an alternative to B31.3 323.2.2 and Table 323.2.2 cells A‐4 and B‐4, high alloy steel materials (austenitic stainless steels) listed in Section VIII Div 1 Table UHA‐ 23 used in cryogenic piping with MDMTs colder than 77 K may instead be subjected to all requirements of UHA‐51.”
UHA-51 (g) exempts from impact testing materials listed in Table UHA-23, except as modified by UHA-51 (c), when ratio of design stress to allowable stress is less than 0.35. UHA-51 (c) (1) requires impact testing if the material has been thermally treated at temperatures between 900 F and 1650 F for austenitic steel. Off-the-shelf 304 and 316 steel is subject to annealing at temperatures above 1800 F and, therefore, is exempt from this requirement. As shown in Table 4.1, design stress to allowable stress ratio is less than 0.35 and impact testing is not required.

Minimum design temperature of He piping is 77 K. According to “Charpy Impact Testing at LN2 Temperature” Memo (ED0004216):
“All Charpy impact testing requirements have been satisfied for using 304 and 304L piping components with 308L filler metal and a wall thickness of less than 0.359”.  The extensive and successful experience Fermilab has had with the materials listed above has been reinforced with successful Charpy impact testing.  No further testing should be required for most LN2 piping assemblies fabricated by AD/Cryo as long as thickness requirements are met.”
All piping has wall thickness less than 0.359” and satisfies this requirement.

All brazing is made and certified by Fermilab. Code required certifications, e.g. WPS, PQR, are available at [[https://www-tdserver1.fnal.gov/tdweb/ms/Policies/Welding/index.htm][Fermi welding procedures web page]]. Completed inspection forms are included in the Appendix [[*Inspection forms]].

*** Safety
The areas around the piping system must be roped off or barricaded to keep personnel out of the test area during the execution of this procedure.  Signs are to be posted warning personnel that a pressure test is in progress and to keep out of the area (per FESHM 5034 7.1.b.).  Follow Fermilab FESHM guidelines for proper PPE.

*** Hazards
This is a pneumatic pressure test utilizing compressed
src_python{print(f'{pt_fluid_name}')}
gas. There is potential for:
- Exposure to an asphyxiant
- Sudden release of pressure from piping
- Striking hazard due to failure of piping or piping components

Ensure that the piping is securely mounted (per FESHM 5034 7.1.b.).

*** Test Equipment
Refer to Figure [[fig:setup]] for the layout of the test equipment.  The specific requirements for the components are listed in Table [[tab:equipment]]. The test equipment should be tested to be leak free before attaching it to the piping for the pressure test.

-	The relief valve must be tested prior to performing the pressure test procedure to ensure that it is operating properly (per FESHM 5034 7.2.d.).
-	The pressure test gauge (PI-3) calibration should be up-to-date (per FESHM 5034 7.2.b.).

*** Test Preparation
*** Pressure Test
During this test procedure, the pressure will be increased in steps waiting at each step to verify that the pressure remains constant.  If at any time a leak is suspected, reduce the pressure to half of the value for the current step and check for leaks with the soap bubble method.  When a leak is found, the piping must be depressurized before repairing the leak.  (per FESHM 5034 7.3.b. and 3.c.)

1. Increase the pressure in the piping to 25 psig.  Wait 5 minutes.  If no leak is detected, proceed to the next step.
2. Increase the pressure to test pressure with increment of no more than 50 psig.  Wait 5 minutes at each step.  If no leak is detected proceed to next pressure increase step. After reaching the test pressure wait 10 minutes.  If no leak is evident, reduce pressure to design pressure and check all seams and fittings with soap bubble or alternate leak detection method.  (per FESHM 5034 7.3.a and B31.3 345.5.5)
3. When all leak checks have been performed and no leaks exist, depressurize the piping.
4. Restore the system back to its original configuration.
5. Remove the rope/barricades and signs.
