* Introduction
This document constitutes the piping engineering note for {{{SYS_NAME}}}.
The current version of the document is maintained in Team Center {{{DOC_NUM}}}.

The {{{SYS_NAME}}} consists of copper tubing and fittings connecting the purifier panel to different part of IB1 cryosystem, such as: storage dewar, distribution box, horizontal test stands, Mycom and Sullair compressor suction, and buffer tanks. Buffer tanks are associated with the highest pressure the {{{SYS_NAME}}} is exposed to driving the design pressure.

The only source of the cold gas in the {{{SYS_NAME}}} is a 10 ft copper line coming from the storage dewar. This line is only in use when the IB1 cryo system is in shutdown and the storage dewar needs to be purged. Based on extensive operating experience the piping gets cold in the vicinity of HV-315 on top of the Dewar.

The design temperature is chosen to be
src_python{print(f'{T_des.to(ureg.K):.3g~}')}.

The design pressure for {{{SYS_NAME}}} is
src_python{print(f'{P_des.to(ureg.psig):.3g~}')}.


The P&ID of the {{{SYS_NAME}}} is shown in Figure [[fig:P_ID]].

#+CAPTION: The {{{SYS_NAME}}} as shown on P&ID {{{P_ID}}}.
#+NAME: fig:P_ID
[[./images/P_ID.png]]

* Design codes and evaluation criteria
All the piping must meet all of the requirements of Section 5031.1 of the Fermilab ES&H Manual.
#+begin_src python
  print('This section states that piping systems containing gas at a pressure ')
  if P_des > 150 * ureg.psig or T_des < -20 * ureg.degF:
      print('above 150 psig or a temperature below -20 Fahrenheit fall under the category of Normal Fluid Service ')
  else:
      print('below 150 psig and a temperature above -20 Fahrenheit fall under the Category D Fluid Service ')
  print('and shall adhere to the requirements of the ASME Process Piping Code B31.3.')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Materials
The tubing including fittings is fabricated from
#+begin_src python
print(pipes[0].material.name+'.')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

The respective allowable stress from Table A-1 of ASME B31.3 will be used in this analysis.

The {{{SYS_NAME}}} will be operated at temperatures down to src_python{print(f'{T_des.to(ureg.K):.3g~} ({T_des.to(ureg.degF):.3g})')}.
#+begin_src python
  if any(T_des < pipe.material.T_min for pipe in pipes):
    print('This is below the minimum temperature listed for any stainless steel pipe or tube. According to B31.3 Section 323.2.2, impact testing is required for this material except as stated in Table 323.2.2 Note (6) where impact testing is not required when the minimum obtainable Charpy specimen has a width along the notch of less than 2.5 mm (0.098 in).')
    if not any(pipe.wall >= 0.098*ureg.inch for pipe in pipes):
      print('All of the tubing and piping with design minimum temperature below -20 F used in the {{{SYS_NAME}}} has a wall thickness of less than 0.098 in. Therefore, impact testing is not required for this piping system.')
  else:
    print('This is above the minimum temperature listed for all materials used in the system. According to B31.3 Section 323.2.2 (d), impact testing is not required for base metal of such piping.')


#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

According to Table 323.2.2, box A-6, there are no additional requirements for HAZ and the braze metal unless filler metal composition is outside the range for base metal composition. For copper brazing the filler metal will be significantly different from the base metal so the impact test will be required. Except for as stated in Note 5, when the maximum obtainable specimen has a width along the notch of less than 0.098 in. All of the piping in {{{SYS_NAME}}} satisfies the requirement of Note 5 (see Table [[tab:pipe_wall]]) and therefore is exempt from testing.

#+begin_comment
It should also be noted that Fermilab has extensive service experience using the 300 series stainless steel at liquid nitrogen temperatures and below.

Wall thickness of the 1.5” SCH 10 pipe is 0.109” which is greater than minimum obtainable Charpy specimen. According to Policy for Fracture Toughness Testing Requirements for Pressure Systems and Components at Low Cryogenic Temperatures  from 5/7/2010 recommends:
“As an alternative to B31.3 323.2.2 and Table 323.2.2 cells A‐4 and B‐4, high alloy steel materials (austenitic stainless steels) listed in Section VIII Div 1 Table UHA‐ 23 used in cryogenic piping with MDMTs colder than 77 K may instead be subjected to all requirements of UHA‐51.”
UHA-51 (g) exempts from impact testing materials listed in Table UHA-23, except as modified by UHA-51 (c), when ratio of design stress to allowable stress is less than 0.35. UHA-51 (c) (1) requires impact testing if the material has been thermally treated at temperatures between 900 F and 1650 F for austenitic steel. Off-the-shelf 304 and 316 steel is subject to annealing at temperatures above 1800 F and, therefore, is exempt from this requirement. As shown in Table 4.1, design stress to allowable stress ratio is less than 0.35 and impact testing is not required.

Minimum design temperature of He piping is 77 K. According to “Charpy Impact Testing at LN2 Temperature” Memo (ED0004216):
“All Charpy impact testing requirements have been satisfied for using 304 and 304L piping components with 308L filler metal and a wall thickness of less than 0.359”.  The extensive and successful experience Fermilab has had with the materials listed above has been reinforced with successful Charpy impact testing.  No further testing should be required for most LN2 piping assemblies fabricated by AD/Cryo as long as thickness requirements are met.”
All piping has wall thickness less than 0.359” and satisfies this requirement.

#+end_comment
The {{{SYS_NAME}}} will be pressure tested in accordance with B31.3 345.5.4. For a pneumatic test, the test pressure is 110% of the design pressure (src_python{print(f'{P_des:.3g~}')}) or src_python{print(f'{P_test:.3g~}')}. The test medium will be gaseous helium.  After this document is reviewed and the pressure tests completed, copies of the witnessed pressure test permits will be included in the Appendix [[*Pressure testing permits]].
Procedure for pressure testing of {{{SYS_NAME}} is attached in Appendix [[*Pressure testing procedure]].
* Summary
The design of the {{{SYS_NAME}}} documented in this note is adequate to ensure that its operation presents no hazards to personnel.

* Appendix
(Pressure test permits will be appended after this note is approved and the pressure tests are completed.)

** Pressure testing procedure
*** Safety
The areas around the piping system must be roped off or barricaded to keep personnel out of the test area during the execution of this procedure.  Signs are to be posted warning personnel that a pressure test is in progress and to keep out of the area (per FESHM 5034 7.1.b.).  Follow Fermilab FESHM guidelines for proper PPE.

*** Hazards
This is a pneumatic pressure test utilizing compressed
src_python{print(f'{pt_fluid_name}')}
gas. There is potential for:
- Exposure to an asphyxiant
- Sudden release of pressure from piping
- Striking hazard due to failure of piping or piping components
The pressure test area will be roped off at a radius larger than an estimated blast radius (see Table [[tab:blast_radius]]).

Ensure that the piping is securely mounted (per FESHM 5034 7.1.b.).

*** Test Equipment
Refer to Figure [[fig:setup]] for the layout of the test equipment.  The specific requirements for the components are listed in Table [[tab:equipment]]. The test equipment should be tested to be leak free before attaching it to the piping for the pressure test.

-	The relief valve must be tested prior to performing the pressure test procedure to ensure that it is operating properly (per FESHM 5034 7.2.d.).
-	The pressure test gauge (PI-3) calibration should be up-to-date (per FESHM 5034 7.2.b.).

**** Perform the pressure test according to section [[*Pressure Test]].
**** Switch HV-401 ALT to alternative direction
**** Perform the pressure test according to section [[*Pressure Test]].
*** Pressure Test
During this test procedure, the pressure will be increased in steps waiting at each step to verify that the pressure remains constant.  If at any time a leak is suspected, reduce the pressure to half of the value for the current step and check for leaks with the soap bubble method.  When a leak is found, the piping must be depressurized before repairing the leak.  (per FESHM 5034 7.3.b. and 3.c.)

1. Increase the pressure in the piping to 25 psig.  Wait 5 minutes.  If no leak is detected, proceed to the next step.
2. Increase the pressure to test pressure with increment of no more than 50 psig.  Wait 5 minutes at each step.  If no leak is detected proceed to next pressure increase step. After reaching the test pressure wait 10 minutes.  If no leak is evident, reduce pressure to design pressure and check all seams and fittings with soap bubble or alternate leak detection method.  (per FESHM 5034 7.3.a and B31.3 345.5.5)
3. When all leak checks have been performed and no leaks exist, depressurize the piping.
4. Restore the system back to its original configuration.
5. Remove the rope/barricades and signs.
