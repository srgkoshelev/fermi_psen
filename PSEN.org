* Introduction
This document constitutes the piping engineering note for {{{SYS_NAME}}}.

During the 2020 IB1 Shutdown the TeV Quench tanks will be disconnected from the IB1 cryo system. Connection piping will be cut off and capped off at following locations (see [[fig:P_ID]] for details).
1. HV-XXXX
1. HV-XXXX
1. HV-XXXX

The design pressure for {{{SYS_NAME}}} is src_python{print(f'{P_des.to(ureg.psig):.3g~}')}.


The P&ID of the {{{SYS_NAME}}} is shown in Figure [[fig:P_ID]].

All the piping must meet all of the requirements of Section 5031.1 of the Fermilab ES&H Manual.

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_comment
It should also be noted that Fermilab has extensive service experience using the 300 series stainless steel at liquid nitrogen temperatures and below.

Wall thickness of the 1.5” SCH 10 pipe is 0.109” which is greater than minimum obtainable Charpy specimen. According to Policy for Fracture Toughness Testing Requirements for Pressure Systems and Components at Low Cryogenic Temperatures  from 5/7/2010 recommends:
“As an alternative to B31.3 323.2.2 and Table 323.2.2 cells A‐4 and B‐4, high alloy steel materials (austenitic stainless steels) listed in Section VIII Div 1 Table UHA‐ 23 used in cryogenic piping with MDMTs colder than 77 K may instead be subjected to all requirements of UHA‐51.”
UHA-51 (g) exempts from impact testing materials listed in Table UHA-23, except as modified by UHA-51 (c), when ratio of design stress to allowable stress is less than 0.35. UHA-51 (c) (1) requires impact testing if the material has been thermally treated at temperatures between 900 F and 1650 F for austenitic steel. Off-the-shelf 304 and 316 steel is subject to annealing at temperatures above 1800 F and, therefore, is exempt from this requirement. As shown in Table 4.1, design stress to allowable stress ratio is less than 0.35 and impact testing is not required.

Minimum design temperature of He piping is 77 K. According to “Charpy Impact Testing at LN2 Temperature” Memo (ED0004216):
“All Charpy impact testing requirements have been satisfied for using 304 and 304L piping components with 308L filler metal and a wall thickness of less than 0.359”.  The extensive and successful experience Fermilab has had with the materials listed above has been reinforced with successful Charpy impact testing.  No further testing should be required for most LN2 piping assemblies fabricated by AD/Cryo as long as thickness requirements are met.”
All piping has wall thickness less than 0.359” and satisfies this requirement.

The {{{SYS_NAME}}} doesn't introduce any changes to the piping pressure relief. All modified parts are protected by respective reliefs of the IB1 cryosystem.

* Flexibility analysis
The {{{SYS_NAME}}} creates no additional constraints to IB1 piping.
